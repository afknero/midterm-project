              by CIRCLE shows that as of early September 2024, youth voter
              registration in 34 states remains lower than on Election Day 2020.
              However, some states have shown significant increases in youth
              registrations since July, especially among the youngest eligible
              voters. Although lower counts are expected at this stage, the
              majority of states show fewer registered young voters, emphasizing
              the need for robust youth outreach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eight states have already report higher youth voter registration
              compared to 2020, while the rest face challenges, particularly
              among newly eligible 18 and 19 year olds, with the majority of
              these states being more than 20% behind.

          <h3>Gen Z's Voting Apathy</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              According to a recent
              <a
                href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a62300710/gen-z-election-2024-not-voting/"
                >survey</a
              >, while many Gen Z voters intend on participating in the upcoming
              presidential election, some have opted not to cast their ballots.
              This group cites a range of concerns, including feelings of
              fatigue, disappointment, and indifference towards the political
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, some young voters are disillusioned with the current
              political landscape, feeling that neither candidate represents
              their values. Concerns about U.S. foreign policy and the broader
              impact of their vote contribute to their reluctance, as they worry
              that voting might inadvertently endorse candidates who don't
              reflect their beliefs or priorities.

          <h3>Voter Engagement and its Implications</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Recent U.S. elections highlight the impact of intermittent
              voters—those who vote in some elections but not others—on
              political outcomes. From 2018 to 2022, 70% of eligible U.S. adults
              voted in at least one election, but only 37% voted in all three.
              These voters are nearly evenly divided between Democratic and
              Republican affiliations, making their participation critical for
              both parties in closely contested races.
            </p>
            <p>
              Patterns vary among those who voted in some but not all elections
              as shown in the graph on the right. This divide highlights a
              large, politically balanced group that could sway future
              elections, emphasizing the importance of engaging intermittent and
              non-voters.
