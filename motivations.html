        <h3>A Politically Active Generation</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Gen Z's voter turnout in the 2022 midterms was higher than that of
            Millennials and Gen X when they comprised the 18-24 age group,
            reflecting an increase in political engagement among today's youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Census data shows that 28.4% of Gen Z voters ages 18-24 cast ballots
            in 2022, a significant uptick from Millennials' 23% turnout in 2006
            and Gen X's 23.5% in 1990. This trend also surpasses the Baby
            Boomers' turnout of 27.9% in their second midterm election in 1974,
            marking Gen Z as one of the most engaged youth voting blocs in
            recent history.

        <h3>Engage and Empower the Next Generation</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Youth voter turnout is on the rise, with U.S. Census Bureau data
            showing that approximately half of 18 to 24-year-olds voted in the
            2020 presidential election.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recent election cycles have demonstrated positive growth in youth
            participation, making it crucial to sustain this momentum. Gen Z has
            the power to shape future elections by actively engaging in voter
            registration and education initiatives. Let's build on this success
            and ensure that your voice is heard!
